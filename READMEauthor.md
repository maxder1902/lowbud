LowBud, the acronym for "Low Budget" is a project made to visualize offers from different supermarkets and choose the best option. Currently is not finished yet,
it kinda works though. Feel free to contribute to this project or the scraping project related made with Node. In the near future, this project will have more features,
not only showing the prices, my goal is to make easier the election for supermarket products based on price and quality. I want to analyze the given data and give a
good output for the user.
